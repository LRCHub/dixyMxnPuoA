[00:03.69] After that confrontation
[00:07.21] You left me wringing my cold hands
[00:10.83] We shared some information
[00:13.57] We might not recover from
[00:26.07] 
[00:18.05] And I'll watch your convictions
[00:22.62] Melt like ice cubes in an ocean
[00:26.22] You were so poorly cast as a malcontent
[00:33.48] You've got 'em all on your side
[00:48.98] 
[00:36.19] That just leaves more for doubt to slaughter
[00:40.60] "I never knew he thought that!"
[00:43.43] I heard you say falling out of the van
[00:47.96] "Don't ask for his opinion
[01:00.96] 
[00:50.66] They ought to drown him in holy water"
[00:55.19] Will you remember my reply
[00:59.72] When your high horse dies?
[01:04.29] We'd like to go the distance
[01:18.29] 
[01:07.88] But not a one of us is gonna
[01:12.37] You see no body is wise enough to turn this ancient boat around
[01:19.53] These are the muddy waters
[01:23.23] I'm swimming in to make a living
[01:26.84] That I might drown in them
[01:28.67] Should come as no surprise
[01:34.05] You want'em all on your side
[01:37.69] That just leaves more for doubt to slaughter
[01:41.28] "I never knew he thought that!"
[01:44.03] I heard you say falling out of the van
[01:48.56] "Don't ask for his opinion
[01:52.10] They ought to drown him in holy water"
[01:56.67] Will you remember my reply
[01:59.38] When your high horse dies?
[02:34.61] You've got'em all on your side
[02:38.27] That just leaves more for doubt to slaughter
[02:41.80] "I never knew he thought that!"
[02:45.45] I heard you say falling out of the van
[02:49.94] "Don't ask for his opinion
[02:52.75] They ought to drown him in holy water"
[02:57.27] Will you remember my reply?
[03:01.77] One finger parallel to the sky
