You been movin' too fast
Gettin' there too slow
Must be spinning your wheels

You've been hangin' long
And riding low
Just looking for a place to be still

Maybe there ain't nothing I can do
Cause I'm losing my rhythm
Trying to keep up with you

Better get off of your high horse baby
Before you hit the dirt
Better get off of your high horse
Done got your quarter's worth

You can whip it hard
You can whip it mean
It don't change a thing

Where you gonna go but up and down
No-one hears you scream
I thought that you and me was in tune
But you keep on howling when
There ain't no moon

Better get off of your high horse baby
Come on down to Earth
Better get off of your high horse
Done got your money's worth

Time flies by
And it stops so hard
And you wonder where you've been

You can keep on rompin' but
Whatcha gonna do when
The thrill comes to an end

I hate to tell you baby
But your saddle's getting kind of loose
I am tired of dealing with your nasty attitude

Better get off of that high horse baby
Before you hit the ground
Better get off of that high horse
It's a long way down

Better get off of your high horse baby
Come on down to Earth
Better get off of your high horse
Done got your money's worth.
