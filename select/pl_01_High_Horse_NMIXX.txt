Sick of that high horse,
I just can't take it no more
텅 빈 대화
I'm lost and found
판단하지 what you are
쉽게 말해 다 who you are, oh
내 귀엔 their lies,
I hear what's inside
So let's ride to the front line
갈 수 있는 가장 끝까지
너와 더 멀리
To end up where
we're meant to be
Heartbreak 지겨워
눈뜨기 싫은 every morning
Run away 비좁은 frame
Heartbreak 지겨워
눈뜨기 싫은 every morning
Run away 비좁은 frame
내려다보는
따가운 시선
뛰어넘어
Go on, go on
They can't tell you what you are
if y'already know who you are,
oh
I will love you
when all is gone
So let's ride to the front line
갈 수 있는 가장 끝까지
너와 더 멀리
To end up where
we're meant to be
So let's ride to the front line
익숙한 곳을 벗어나
너와 있을게
꿈꾼 적 없는 곳까지
Lights flash, bass drop
Baby, I'm on whatever
Hands up, heartbeats
No telling where I'll go
Heartquake 눈을 떠
웅크렸던 every morning
Run away, do it my way
Sick of that high horse,
our minds don't work like theirs
