Get off your high horse and bow before me

Silver stairs to a castle so high
That from the tallest tower you can touch the sky
On an island in an endless sea of sun
The devil dances on the horizon

With your ear in the clouds
I guess it's hard to hear the sound of a dying world
Where pure evil courses through its veins
We're just a stain in your beautiful creation

The poison to your apple
We picked all those years ago
We are the poison

You're just a snake in the grass
That always seems to slither right through the cracks unscathed
But you have no one to save you now

I am filled with rage
I am filled with hate

Your way with words is your only asset
Wormed your way into every aspect of my life
What makes you think I'd give up without a fight?
Get off your high horse and bow before me

Silver stairs to a castle so high
That from the tallest tower you can touch the sky
On an island in an endless sea of sun
The devil dances on the horizon
